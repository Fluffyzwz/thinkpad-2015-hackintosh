## Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 3rd Gen Hackintosh Guide

<details>  
<summary><strong>Getting Started</strong></summary>
</br>

To start you'll need the following:

You must have the following items:
- Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 3rd Gen (Obviously üòÅ).
- Access to a working Windows machine with Python installed.
- A pendrive with more than 4 GB (Keep in mind, during the preperation we will format the disk to create the install media).
- an Internet connection via Ethernet.
- 1-2 hours of your time.

<summary><strong>Creating the USB Installer </strong></summary>
</br>

1. To grab legacy installers is super easy, first grab a copy of [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) and head to /Utilities/macrecovery/. Next copy the folder path for the macrecovery folder. 

<img width="974" alt="file-path 0aea4278" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72415505/156628158-190cba5d-6114-4972-aa83-f1b14749e34d.png">


#
2. From here, you'll want to open up a Command Prompt and cd into the macrecovery folder that we copied earlier:

```cd Paste_Folder_Path```

#
3. Now run one of the following depending on what version of macOS you want(Note these scripts rely on [Python](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) support, please install if you haven't already):

 ```
# Monterey (12)
python macrecovery.py -b Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6 -m 00000000000000000 download
```

This will take some time, however once you're finished you should get either BaseSystem or RecoveryImage files:

#
4. Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/), set the BOOT selection as not bootable, set File System as Large FAT32, click Start, and delete all file autorun in USB Drive partition.

#
5. Next, go to the root of this USB drive and create a folder called com.apple.recovery.boot. Then move the downloaded BaseSystem or RecoveryImage files. Please ensure you copy over both the .dmg and .chunklist files to this folder:

6. Open up and extract the EFI folder archive you downloaded earlier.
